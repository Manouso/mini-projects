# Machine Learning Mini Projects

A collection of data science and machine learning mini projects built to strengthen core concepts — from linear regression to real-world data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.

## Projects Included

### 1. Linear Regression Basics
- Implemented linear regression from scratch using NumPy and compared results with scikit-learn’s `LinearRegression`.
- Demonstrated understanding of model training, prediction, and evaluation (MSE, R²).
- Dataset: Salary vs Experience data from Kaggle.

### 2. Advertising Dataset EDA
- Performed exploratory data analysis on an advertising dataset.
- Identified correlations between marketing channels and sales.
- Created clear visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Dataset: Kaggle Advertising dataset.

### 3. Titanic Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Cleaned and preprocessed the Titanic dataset for machine learning.
- Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled continuous features.
- Engineered new features (`FamilySize`, `IsAlone`) and analyzed their effect on survival.
- Dataset: Kaggle Titanic dataset.

### 4. Logistic Regression on Pre-Processed Titanic Data
- Implemented Logistic Regression on the pre-processed data from the previous project.
- Used cross-validation to improve model's training.
- Applied Hyperparameter tuning to find the best hyperparameters to improve model's performance.
- Visualized the importance of model's features and ordered based on their coefficients.
- Dataset: Kaggle Titanic dataset.

### 5. Decision Trees on Pre-Processed Titanic Data
- Built a Decision Tree classifier on the preprocessed Titanic dataset.
- Explored the effect of `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, and `min_samples_leaf` on model performance.
- Visualized decision tree structure and feature importance.
- Dataset: Kaggle Titanic dataset.

### 6. Pipelines with Logistic Regression on Titanic Data
- Built a full scikit-learn pipeline including:
  - Feature engineering
  - Column dropping
  - Numeric preprocessing
  - Categorical preprocessing
  - Logistic Regression classifier
- Integrated hyperparameter tuning inside the pipeline to avoid data leakage.
- Measured model accuracy and training time with cross-validation.
- Dataset: Kaggle Titanic dataset.


### 7. Pipelines with Decision Trees on Housing Data
- Built a Decision Tree Regression pipeline for the **Ames Housing dataset**.
- Handled missing values, one-hot encoded categorical variables, and scaled numeric features inside the pipeline.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning (`max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf`) using cross-validation.
- Evaluated model performance using RMSE and visualized feature importances.
- Dataset: [Ames Housing Dataset (CSV)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/master/AmesHousing.csv)
