# Machine Learning Mini Projects

A collection of data science and machine learning mini projects built to strengthen core concepts — from linear regression to real-world data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.

---

## Projects Included

### 1. Linear Regression Basics
- Implemented linear regression from scratch using NumPy and compared results with scikit-learn’s `LinearRegression`.
- Demonstrated understanding of model training, prediction, and evaluation (MSE, R²).
- Dataset: Salary vs Experience data from Kaggle.

### 2. Advertising Dataset EDA
- Performed exploratory data analysis on an advertising dataset.
- Identified correlations between marketing channels and sales.
- Created clear visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Dataset: Kaggle Advertising dataset.

### 3. Titanic Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Cleaned and preprocessed the Titanic dataset for machine learning.
- Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled continuous features.
- Engineered new features (`FamilySize`, `IsAlone`, `Title`) and analyzed their effect on survival.
- Dataset: Kaggle Titanic dataset.
