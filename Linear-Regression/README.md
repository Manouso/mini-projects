# Linear Regression Basics

This mini project demonstrates Linear Regression both from scratch and using scikit-learn library.

## Objectives

- Understand the mathematics behind Linear Regression 
- Implement the model manually to understand it in depth (using Python and NumPy)
- Using scikit-learn's LinearRegression and compare it with my implementation

---

## Dataset

- Source: [Salary Dataset - Simple Linear Regression (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/salary-dataset-simple-linear-regression)
- Columns:
    - `YearsExperience`: Years of professional experience
    - `Salary`: Annual salary in USD

---

## Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

## Results

- Both implementations produce similar regression lines.
- Predictions visualized against actual values to confirm performance.
