# LightGBM Heart Disease Prediction

This project demonstrates the development of a **LightGBM classifier** for predicting heart disease using structured clinical data. LightGBM is a state-of-the-art gradient boosting framework optimized for speed, scalability, and accuracy.

## Objectives

- Implement a complete ML workflow using **LightGBM**
- Use **Pipelines** and **ColumnTransformers** for preprocessing
- Perform **hyperparameter tuning** with cross-validation
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualize **feature importances**

## Dataset

[Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)

This dataset contains 918 patient records, each with 11 clinical features that are commonly used in cardiovascular diagnostics.
The goal is to predict whether a patient is likely to develop heart disease based on medical measurements, lifestyle indicators, and symptoms.
