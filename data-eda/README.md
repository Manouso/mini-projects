## Insights

- TV advertising exhibits the strongest positive correlation with Sales (≈0.9), indicating that increased TV spending is consistently associated with higher revenue.

- Radio advertising shows a moderate positive relationship with Sales (≈0.35), suggesting it contributes decently but less powerfully than TV.

- Newspaper advertising demonstrates a weak correlation with Sales (≈0.16), implying minimal impact on revenue performance.

- Newspaper spend is right-skewed, indicating that only a few instances involve very high investment in this channel.

- The distribution of Sales is approximately normal, showing no significant outliers.

- Overall, the analysis suggests that TV and Radio are the most effective advertising channels for driving sales, while Newspaper contributes the least.
