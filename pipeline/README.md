# Pipeline Implementation Project

This Project demonstrates how to build pipelines for Machine Learning practices and evaluates them to see why pipelines are
useful and how much do they benefit the programmer and the user.

## Project Structure

- **pipeline/**
  - `pipeline_logistic_regression.ipynb` — Main notebook for experiments  
  - `requirements.txt` — Requirements  
  - `README.md` — Project overview

---

## Objectives

- Understand why pipelines are useful
- Build pipeline to do Logistic Regression and Scaling (Standard Scaler)
- Evaluate and compare pipeline against my previous project without pipeline.

## Dataset

- Columns: 
   - `Survived`: Index of survival (1 = survived, 0 = didn't survived)     
   - `Pclass`: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)            
   - `Sex`: Male/Female         
   - `Age`: Age in years         
   - `FamilySize`: How many family members were aboard            
   - `Fare`: Passenger Fare       
   - `Cabin`: Number of Cabin       
   - `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C, Q, S) 
   - `IsAlone`: Binary indicator for traveling alone (1 = alone, 0 = not alone)
